Learn design patterns (theoretically and then practically)
==========================================================
Method
------
- Theory learned thanks to explanations, diagrams, and pseudo-code (see [credits](#credits) section).
-  Practice in PHP to reproduce patterns in real case (**without "copy pasta programming"**).

Goals
-----
- Known the different design patterns (global functioning and pros and cons depending on the situation).
- Be able to reuse the most popular design patterns depending on the project's structure.

Thanks to [Refactoring Guru ](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) for explanations about design patterns and refactoring who teach me these patterns from scratch. It's a good website to start because they explain well, for e.g. without any technical ambiguity or acronym.
