Design patterns (theory & practice)
==========================================================
Personal project to learn design patterns.

<!-- TODO: Add summary -->

Method
------
- Theory learned in the first step from explanations, diagrams, and pseudo-code (see [credits](#credits) section). In this section, I will try to reformulate these notions in order to appropriate them before practice. 
-  Training in PHP to reproduce design patterns in the real case (**without "copy pasta programming" or something like that**).

Intention
-----
- Known the different design patterns (global functioning and pros and cons depending on the situation).
- Be able to reuse the most popular design patterns depending on the project's structure.

Thanks to [Refactoring Guru ](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) for explanations about design patterns and refactoring who teach me these patterns from scratch. It's a good website to start because they explain well, for e.g. without any technical ambiguity or acronym.
