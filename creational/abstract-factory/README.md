Abstract Factory
================
Family : Creational Design Patterns

When use a factory ?
--------------------

Family of specific object without specifying the concrete classes.

But create individual object that they match other objects of the same family to keep the logic. 

Notion of consistency between objects because it's not make sense for e.g to have a modern table with victorian chairs.


| Style  / Type  |      Table                    | Chair                       |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Art Deco        |Original table                 |Original chair               |
|Victorian       |Old school table               |Old school chair             |
|Modern          |Modern table                   |Modern chair                 |



Pros
----
- More flexible than a factory but more complex
